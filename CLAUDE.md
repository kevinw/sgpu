# Project description
- A thin gpu abstraction library over Metal and Vulkan.

# Bash commands
- run-examples.sh: Build and run the examples

# Code style
- For Jai casts: prefer the cast(s32)foo syntax instead of foo.(s32)
- Jai's standard library can be found at ~/jai/modules but we should not make changes there.

# Workflow
- Ensure examples run when you're done making a series of code changes.
